### The Capstone Projects Intro:

"You have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants.  In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, your organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. As a Data Analyst, you will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills."

### Tasks included:

*Task_1:* 

Initiation of the Data Analysis process with Data collection through [APIs](Week%201.1%20Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API.ipynb) and [Web Scraping](Week%201.2%20Web-Scraping.ipynb) (from Kaggle & GitHub respectivly);

*Task_2:*

After that, with a [modified subset of the Stack Overflow survey dataset](datasets/m1_survey_data.csv), the data were wrangled in order to remove duplicates, impute missing values & normalize them;

*Task_3:*

The data underwent [exploratory analysis](Week%203%20-%20M3_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb) in order to find the distribution of them, presence of outliers & determine the correlation between different columns in the dataset (**);

*Task_4:*

[Visualization](Week%204%20-%20M4_DataVisualization.ipynb) of the distribution, the inter-relationship, the composition & comparison of data (**);

*Task_5:*

Finally, by utilizing two new files ([m5_survey_data_demographics.csv](datasets/m5_survey_data_demographics.csv) & [m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv](datasets/m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv)) which were also modified subset of Stack Overflow survey dataset, a [Dashboard](Week%205%20-%20M5_Dashboard.pdf) was created through Cognos Dashboard Embedded (showing the ‘Current Technology Usage’, ‘Future Technology Usage’ & ‘Demographics’ in the three tabs, respectively.

Lastly, a [Report](Week%206%20-%20Capstone_Project_Reporting.pdf) of the results was created in order to be present the findings of the Data Analysis process. 


*(**) Through Tasks 2 & 3, some visualizations were created using Plotly so as to add interactivity. Github does not support interactive notebooks therefore feel free to download the jupyter files & run them on your local machines.*
